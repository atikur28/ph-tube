            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center md:text-left">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left">'var', 'let', and 'const' are three different ways to declare variables in JavaScript. They have varying scopes and behaviors, which affect how they can be used and accessed within your code. Let's discuss the scope of each:</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> var:</strong>
                The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="px-7 my-4 lg:px-20">
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> let:</strong>
                The keyword let in Javascript is used to declare a variable that is block scoped in JavaScript. In JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any other variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="px-7 lg:px-20">
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> const:</strong>
                We use the const keyword in JavaScript to declare variables whose value can be initialized only at the time of declaration.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left my-3">
                In modern JavaScript development, it's generally recommended to use 'let' and 'const' over 'var', due to their more predictable scoping behavior and better support for block scoping. If you need a variable that won't be reassigned, prefer 'const'. If you expect the variable's value to change, use 'let'. This helps in writing cleaner, more maintainable, and less error-prone code.

        <section class="px-7 mt-6 lg:px-20">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center md:text-left">2. The use cases of null and undefined.</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left">'null' and 'undefined' are two distinct values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a meaningful value. While they might seem similar, they have slightly different use cases:</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> undefined:</strong>
                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="px-7 my-4 lg:px-20">
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> null:</strong>
              In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="px-7 lg:px-20">
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left my-3">
                In conclusion, 'undefined' is often used to represent the absence of value due to lack of assignment or accessing non-existent properties, while 'null' is used to intentionally indicate that a variable or property holds no meaningful value. It's important to understand the distinctions between these two values to ensure that your code behaves as expected and is easier to debug.

        <section class="px-7 mt-6 lg:px-20">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-center md:text-left">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left">REST stands for "Representational State Transfer" and a REST API is a set of rules and conventions that allow different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It is a common architectural style used for designing networked applications. 
                The key principles of a REST API include:</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> Stateless Communication:</strong>
                Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed for the server to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any previous requests to fulfill the current one.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> HTTP Methods:</strong>
                REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to indicate the intended action on the resource. The most commonly used HTTP methods are:
                <li class="text-lg">GET: Retrieve data from the server.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">POST: Create new data on the server.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">PUT: Update existing data on the server.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">DELETE: Remove data from the server.</li>
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg my-4 text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> Resources and URIs:</strong>
                Resources are the entities that the API manages, such as users, products, or orders. Each resource is identified by a unique URL called a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). For example, /users might refer to a collection of users, and /users/123 might refer to a specific user with the ID 123.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> Representation:</strong>
                Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients and servers can negotiate the representation format in the HTTP headers.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg my-4 text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> Response Codes:</strong>
                HTTP status codes are used to indicate the outcome of a request. For example, a successful GET request might return a status code of 200 (OK), while a request to a non-existent resource might return a 404 (Not Found) status.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left"><strong>=> HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State):</strong>
                This principle suggests that the API should provide hyperlinks to related resources in its responses. Clients can navigate through the API using these links instead of relying on prior knowledge.
            </p>

        <section class="px-7 mb-20 lg:px-20">
            <p class="text-lg text-justify md:text-left my-3">
                A typical interaction with a REST API involves sending an HTTP request with the appropriate method and headers to a specific URI, and then receiving an HTTP response containing the requested data or indicating the outcome of the operation.
